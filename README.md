# glucose_report

## **Introduction**

This python script takes the JSON export form the XDrip4iOS app (https://github.com/JohanDegraeve/xdripswift) and creates a PDF report for the 90 day period. 

It sums A1c% and hbA1c for the 90 days. 

There then follows some visualizations showing mean glucose readings for each day in the 90 day period, an average week and for each hour in an average day. 

The final set of visualisations shows % of time in high, low, in-range.
